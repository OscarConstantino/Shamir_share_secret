# The program is meant to show a simple implementation of the Shamir algorithm which shares a secret and can be recovered with 
# an specific number of the shares.
# It is important to select a big prime number to perfrom the operations correctly.
# This program is limitaded to a prime number of size 2**4096 + 1761, if a larger number is required, it is necessary to 
# calculate a big prime number and set it manually.

#The program requires the next packages:
    # os
    # math
# The program uses the urandom package to generate random numbers directly from the OS.
# The sqrt function is used during the prime number verification.
